This App should display markers on a map representing locations in the water system.
These markers will be colour-coded based on the status of these locations,
and clickable to get further information.

The PumpMapOne class is an Activity that displays the map, and allows zooming and scrolling.
It also instantiates the other classes used.

The StatusOverlay class implements an overlay over the map that allows icons to be placed representing locations in the database
